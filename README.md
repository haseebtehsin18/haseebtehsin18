## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me
Hey there! I'm Abdul Haseeb, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Muhammad Ali Jinnah University (M.A.J.U). Prior to that, I completed my intermediate degree in Pre-Engineering. My journey into programming began when I enrolled in a Python programming course offered by "BanoQabil," where I learned the fundamentals and advanced concepts of Python programming.
I'm enthusiastic about leveraging my skills to contribute meaningfully to the field of software development and am always eager to learn and grow as a developer.

## Projects
Here are a few projects I've been working on:

1. Address Book Application.
   (https://github.com/haseebtehsin18/BanoQabil_2.0_Python_Course/blob/main/Address%20Book%20Application): Add Contacts: Easily add new contacts with their name, phone number, and email address. Display Contacts: View a list of all contacts along with their details. Edit Contacts: Modify the details of existing contacts seamlessly. Adding Contacts: Follow the prompts to add a new contact. Displaying Contacts: View the list of all existing contacts. Editing Contacts: Select a contact and provide new details to update their information.

2. Snake Game.
   (https://github.com/haseebtehsin18/BanoQabil_2.0_Python_Course/tree/main/Final%20project): In this classic sanke game, players control a snake as it navigates through a maze, devouring fruits and avoiding collisions with walls and its own tail. The game features intuitive controls, smooth animations, and dynamic level generation, providing an enjoyable gaming experience for players of all ages.

## Future Plans
I'm excited about what the future holds! Here are some of the things I'm planning to do:

- Learn new Python libraries and frameworks
- Explore other programming languages like JavaScript and Java
- Contribute to open-source projects
- Build more complex and impactful projects

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to grow as a developer!
